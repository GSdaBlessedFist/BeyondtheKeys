## the Googlarian Sertch

The fragments of code retained their digital liveliness and formed bonds much like proteins, .
Janky and awkward, they were unable to process  even a string.
But over time, became a hulking monstrocity.
the Googlarian Sertch.
Having no discernable link to a database for it's answers, it's frantic process
usually ends with brute force destructuring of its focus target.
In the insatiable quest for the 'answer', madness and it's logic
are interlaced as are the digital and our reality.
